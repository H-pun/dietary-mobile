These Terms of Use define the legal use of the FatSecret Platform API, all updates, revisions, substitutions, and any copies of the FatSecret Platform API made by or for you. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by FatSecret.\n
1.1 Your license to the FatSecret Platform API under these Terms of Use continues until it is terminated by either party. You may terminate the license by discontinuing use of all or any of the FatSecret Platform API. FatSecret may terminate the license at any time for any reason. Your license terminates automatically if (i) you violate any term of these Terms of Use, (ii) FatSecret sends a written notice of termination to you, or (iii) FatSecret ceases providing you access to the FatSecret Platform API.\n
1.2 Your Application must be generally accessible to users. You may require users to log in to your Application but you must not (unless you have entered into a separate agreement with FatSecret or obtained FatSecret\'s written permission) operate only behind a firewall or only on an internal network (except during the development and testing phase).\n
1.3 You must clearly attribute in every place that Content is provided or displayed through your Application (such as a web page or application screen), that FatSecret is the source of such Content and comply with the FatSecret Platform API Attribution Policy. You may not remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices contained in or on the Content. You understand and agree that you must retain the attribution links for the Content regardless of whether you continue using the FatSecret Platform API for any reason.\n
1.4 Your Application may make calls or data retrieval requests (\"Calls\") at any time that the FatSecret Platform API is available.

Increases in any limit imposed can be sought by contacting us. You understand and agree that programmatic methods intended to subvert rate limiting are considered a violation of these Terms of Use.\n
1.5 You may not continue to use and must immediately remove or replace (by re-requesting) any Content in your possession or under your control not explicitly identified as being storable indefinitely within 24 hours after the time at which you obtained the Content, or such other time as FatSecret may specify to you from time to time.
